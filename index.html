        <p>My name is Sheena Ruben, I'm 26 years old with 4 sons. I've became a mother as a teenager. Little did i know, i would have 2 more after my first two sons. I live in a small town called Longlac, Ontario. I came a long way in my life, I've was a troubled person till today. I got myself the help i need to be the women i am now. I'm so happy to say my kids are my life and so much more.</p>
        <p>Their is alot of stuff about me, i want to share. I guess, i'll start at rock bottom. When i was 20 years old, i lost my kids to the system and i was already into drugs and drinking. But that made things worst for me, cause my kids were my everything, so i went into a depression stage and didn't care about anything or anyone. I always took off on my family to get blacked out, and doing all the drugs i can find or do. I was always on the hunt for my fix and always looking for money or even stealing it off my mother.</p>
        <p>Drugs have a way in ruining people's lives and but alot of people can grow from it like i did, i quit everything it took me a years to quit but here i am not doing nothing, i know i've hurt alot of my family memeber especially my older sons Rylee and Jordyn, I never knew how much pain and suffering of me not being a mother to them, and me as a mother hurting myself for running away from them cause of being an addict and their was no excuse for it but i made them. To this day i feel like i was a bad mom for doing the stuff i did to just go out and drink and have drugs in my system and not being there for them, i still feel the pain i causes them and it's not a pretty feeling at all, but i know my babies love me as i love them and i would do anything for them today. I grew into someone different or someone i losted before becoming an addict, and it makes me happy to say i'm me again! But sometimes the depression kicks in, and makes me replay all the shitty stuff i did, and remember all the embrassing moments or remember leaving my kids with my mom everytime i wanted to go drink and never come back till the weekend was over, and i didn't have time to spend with my sons. I'm making up for it today.</p>
